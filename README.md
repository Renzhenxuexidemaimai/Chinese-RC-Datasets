## Chinese Reading Comprehension Datasets
Here I list several Chinese reading comprehension datasets that are PUBLICLY available (with appropriate technical report or paper). If I missed something, feel free to inform me. Unless indicated, the datasets are in simplified Chinese.

## Chinese Reading Comprehension Evaluation / Competition
Along with the release of these datasets, there are also several Chinese Reading Comprehension evaluation workshops or competitions which further accelerate the research on this topic.

 1. [The First Evaluation Workshop on Chinese Machine Reading Comprehension (CMRC 2017)](https://hfl-rc.github.io/cmrc2017/)
 2. [The Second Evaluation Workshop on Chinese Machine Reading Comprehension (CMRC 2018)](https://hfl-rc.github.io/cmrc2018/)
 3. [2018 NLP Challenge on Machine Reading Comprehension](http://mrc2018.cipsc.org.cn/)
 4. [The Third Evaluation Workshop on Chinese Machine Reading Comprehension (CMRC 2019)](https://hfl-rc.github.io/cmrc2019/)
 5. [2019 NLP Language and Intelligence Challenge](http://lic2019.ccf.org.cn)
